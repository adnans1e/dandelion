## What is Project Dandelion?

Project Dandelion is an education product designed to prepare primary-school aged refugee children for greater cognitive, social, emotional and academic success through the development of social-emotional learning (SEL) skills.

Project Dandelion is based on a whole-community approach to well-being & learning for refugee children. IRC education and R&D specialists started working on Dandelion in 2016. We are currently prototyping and testing Dandelion with communities in Nyarugusu refugee camp, Tanzania. Learn more about our work [here](https://www.rescue.org/airbel-center).
